<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As a project to learn more about Vue and React, I decided to create the GPA calculator that my friends 
and I always wanted. Schools will show your individual course grades and final GPA, but no other 
information. This tool can help you verify your GPA is correct while also providing the ability to 
see the impact of individual courses or semesters on your GPA. You can also test hypothetical 
impacts on your GPA from prospective semesters or courses! When you're done, you can save your 
information to your local computer to load again later.

This calculator was originally built with Vue. I later recreated it with React and Semantic UI React.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (originally)

### How to Use

To use this GPA calculator, simply add semesters and edit them to fill in courses as necessary. You can 
decide whether or not to include each individual semester and course in the GPA. Excluded courses and 
semesters are treated as if they never happened.

Make sure you use the 'Grade' area properly. This accepts either a letter grade (which defaults to 
standard letter grade GPA calculation) or a numeric grade (which is used directly in the GPA calculation). 
If your school doesn't use the standard convention for converting letter grades to GPA points, just 
convert them yourself and input the numeric grade accordingly.
